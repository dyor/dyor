### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on React + PostgreSQL for a Startup App Framework. You can learn more about my project on https://blog.dyor.com/
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source startup frameworks - everything from code to contract (e.g., employment agreements, founder agreements, incorporation).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about startup product management, initial customer acquisition (e.g., landing your first 10 customers). 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdyor/) (but send me a note telling me you came from GitHub so I know it aint spam).
