### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I spent most of my time on Kotlin Multiplatform which allows you to (partially or fully) share code across Android and iOS. The personal KMP app that I am spending most of my time with is [bapdap](https://bapdap.com) - short for build a plan do a plan - an AI assisted planning and execution app. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mobile and/or cryptocurrency projects - in particular mobile projects that leverage crypto for every day stuff (golf wagers, 1031 exchanges, funding startups, buying pizza). I am tracking all of the ideas I am thinking about at [febak](https://febak.com).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about startup product management, initial customer acquisition (e.g., landing your first 10 customers). 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdyor/) (but send me a note telling me you came from GitHub so I know it aint spam).
