### Hi there 👋

- I work a lot with cross platform technology, both *Kotlin Multiplatform* and *React Native*.
- My primary personal project is the Sparks App - an open source app that hosts many vibe-coded "sparks." Each of the sparks is a fun little experience - most written by me, some written by others, and others inspired by others still.
- Contribute your own sparks here on [Spark's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dyor/SparksApp?tab=readme-ov-file#2-using-github-codespaces) or learn more about the app at the [Sparks Website](https://sparks.febak.com). 
- 📫 How to reach me: connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdyor/) (but send me a note telling me you came from GitHub so I know it aint spam).
